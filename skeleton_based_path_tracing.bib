abstract = {When working with large and complex scenes, situations arise where light flux takes complex paths to reach the observer. In such cases, traditional stochastic algorithms, like ray tracing algorithms, will have difficulties to compute noise-free images. Our present research aims to solve this problem using the 3d scene skeleton as a coarse representation. Indeed, curvilinear skeletons can be used to find light paths with higher energy. This article presents our research to use these skeletons for any ray tracing algorithm, allowing a knowledge-based choice when choosing light paths. Our method adds little computation time while producing a more accurate image.}
